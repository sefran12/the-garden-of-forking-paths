The child's face is a blur, but the eyes are unmistakable â€“ they are the same as those of your fallen comrades.

    "Maya, the Heart, showed him this vision: In the heart of Artorias, a vision unfolds, a moment frozen in time. A grand hall, dimly lit by flickering torches, echoes with the sound of a lone lute. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting battles won and lost, and at the center of the room, a round table, empty save for a single figure. Artorias sits, clad in his armor, his gaze fixed on a chalice before him. The chalice, filled with a shimmering liquid, reflects the faces of his fallen comrades, their expressions a mix of pride and sorrow. As Artorias reaches for the chalice, the faces fade, replaced by the image of a young girl, her eyes filled with hope and a smile that warms even the coldest heart. The vision ends as Artorias lifts the chalice to his lips, a silent vow passing between him and the girl, a promise of protection and a future where the horrors of war are but a distant memory. The scene vanishes, leaving only the lingering taste of hope and the bittersweet memory of those who gave their lives for a cause they believed in.\n",
